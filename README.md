A Python implementation of geodesy tools for various ellipsoidal and
spherical earth models using trigonometric and vector-based methods.

Also included are conversions to and from UTM coordinates and MGRS
and OSGR grid references, see:

Another module provides Lambert conformal conic projections and
positions, transcribed from:

The Python code was statically checked with PyChecker, PyFlakes,
Pep8 and pychok* using Python 2.7.10.  The tests were run with
Python 2.7.10, 3.5.1/.2 and 3.6.0rc1, but only on MacOS 10.10
Yosemite and MacOS 10.11 El Capitan.

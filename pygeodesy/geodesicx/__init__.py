u'''A pure Python version of I{Karney}'s C++ classes U{GeodesicExact
<https://GeographicLib.SourceForge.io/C++/classGeographicLib_1_1GeodesicExact.html>}
and U{GeodesicLineExact
<https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/C++/doc/classGeographicLib_1_1GeodesicLine.html>}.

For more details, see the C++ U{GeographicLib<https://GeographicLib.SourceForge.io/C++/doc/index.html>}
documentation, especially the U{Class List<https://GeographicLib.SourceForge.io/C++/doc/annotated.html>}
and the background information on the page U{Geodesics on an ellipsoid of revolution
<https://GeographicLib.SourceForge.io/C++/doc/geodesic.html#geodseries>}.

Also, compare C{GeodesicExact} and C{GeodesicLineExact} to I{standard} classes C{Geodesic}
respectively C{GeodesicLine} from I{Karney}'s Python implementation U{geographiclib
<https://GeographicLib.SourceForge.io/C++/doc/other.html#python>}.

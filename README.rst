A pure Python implementation of geodesy tools for various ellipsoidal and
spherical earth models using precision trigonometric and vector-based
methods for geodetic (lat-/longitude) and geocentric cartesian (x/y/z)
coordinates.

Transcribed from `JavaScript originals`_ by *Chris Veness (C) 2005-2016*
and published under the same `MIT License`_.

There are two modules for ellipsoidal earth models, *ellipsoidalVincenty*
and *-Nvector* and two for spherical ones, *sphericalTrigonometry* and
*-Nvector* . Each module provides a *LatLon* class with methods to compute
distance, initial and final bearing, intermediate points and conversions,
among other things. For more information and further details see the
documentation_, the descriptions of `Latitude/Longitude`_, Vincenty_ and
`Vector-based`_ geodesy and the original `JavaScript source`_ or docs_.

Also included are modules for conversions to and from UTM_ (Universal
Transverse Mercator) coordinates, MGRS_ (NATO Military Grid Reference
System) and OSGR_ (British Ordinance Survery Grid Reference) grid
references and a module for encoding and decoding Geohashes_.

Two other modules provide Lambert conformal conic projections and positions
(from `John P. Snyder`_, *Map Projections -- A Working Manual*, 1987, pp
107-109) and several functions to simplify_ or linearize a path of *LatLon*
points (or a `NumPy array`_), including implementations of the
`Ramer-Douglas-Peucker`_, the `Visvalingam-Whyatt`_ and the `Reumann-Witkam`_
algorithms and modified versions of the former.

All Python source code has been statically checked_ with PyChecker_,
PyFlakes_, PyCodeStyle_ (formerly Pep8) and McCabe_ using 64-bit Python
2.7.14 and with Flake8_ on 64-bit Python 3.6.2.

The tests have been run with 64-bit Python 2.6.9 (and numpy 1.6.2), 2.7.14
(and numpy 1.13.1), 3.5.3 and 3.6.2, but only on MacOSX 10.10 Yosemite, MacOSX
10.11 El Capitan or macOS 10.12.6 Sierra, with 64-bit Intel-Python 3.5.3 (and
numpy 1.11.3) on macOS 10.12.6 Sierra and with Pythonista 3.1 using 64-bit
Python 2.7.12 and 3.5.1 (both with numpy 1.8.0) on iOS 10.3.3.

In addition to the PyGeodesy_ package, the distribution files contain the
tests, the test results and the complete documentation generated by
Epydoc_ using command line: ``epydoc --html --no-private --no-source
--name=PyGeodesy --url=... -v pygeodesy``.

Some function and method names differ from the JavaScript version. In such
cases documentation tag **JS name:** shows the original JavaScript name.

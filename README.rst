PyGeodesy
=========

A pure Python implementation of geodesy tools for various ellipsoidal and
spherical earth models using precision trigonometric and vector-based
methods for geodetic (lat-/longitude) and geocentric cartesian (x/y/z)
coordinates.

Transcribed from `JavaScript originals`_ by *Chris Veness (C) 2005-2016*
and published under the same `MIT License`_.

There are two modules for ellipsoidal earth models, *ellipsoidalVincenty*
and *-Nvector* and two for spherical ones, *sphericalTrigonometry* and
*-Nvector* . Each module provides a *LatLon* class with methods to compute
distance, initial and final bearing, intermediate points and conversions,
among other things. For more information and further details see the
documentation_, descriptions of `Latitude/Longitude`_, Vincenty_ and
`Vector-based`_ geodesy and the original `JavaScript source`_ or docs_.

Also included are modules for conversions to and from UTM_ (Universal
Transverse Mercator) coordinates, MGRS_ (NATO Military Grid Reference
System) and OSGR_ (British Ordinance Survery Grid Reference) grid
references and a module for encoding and decoding Geohashes_.

Two other modules provide Lambert conformal conic projections and positions
(from `John P. Snyder`_, *Map Projections -- A Working Manual*, 1987, pp
107-109) and several functions to simplify_ or linearize a path of *LatLon*
points, including implementations of the `Ramer-Douglas-Peucker`_ and
`Visvalingam-Whyatt`_ algorithms and modified versions of both.

All Python source code has been statically checked_ with PyChecker_,
PyFlakes_, PyCodeStyle_ (formerly Pep8) and McCabe_ using Python 2.7.10
or 2.7.13 and with Flake8_ on Python 3.6.0 or 3.6.1.

The tests have been run with 64-bit Python 2.6.9, 2.7.13, 3.5.3 and
3.6.1, but only on MacOSX 10.10 Yosemite, MacOSX 10.11 El Capitan or
macOS 10.12.2, 10.12.3, 10.12.4 or 10.12.5 Sierra and with Pythonista
3.1 using Python 2.7.12 and 3.5.1 on iOS 10.3.2.

In addition to the PyGeodesy_ package, the distribution files contain the
tests, the test results and the complete documentation_ generated by
Epydoc_ using command line: ``epydoc --html --no-private --no-source
--name=PyGeodesy --url=... -v pygeodesy``. The ``zip`` and ``tar``
distribution files were created with command line ``python setup.py sdist
--formats=zip,gztar,bztar``.

Some function and method names differ from the JavaScript version. In such
cases documentation tag **JS name:** shows the original JavaScript name.
